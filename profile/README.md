# Drexler Lab - Virus Epidemiology 

This is the GitHub organization for the Virus Epidemiology Lab at the Charit√©'s Institute of Virology. It is lead by [Jan Felix Drexler]([https://virologie-ccm.charite.de/en/metas/person_detail/person/address_detail/prof_dr_jan_felix_drexler/](https://virologie-ccm.charite.de/metas/person/person/address_detail/prof_dr_jan_felix_drexler/)). 

We focus on the evolution and epidemiology of emerging viruses at the animal-human interface. Major achievements in the past include the development of affordable tests for HIV, hepatitis C virus and yellow fever virus for Brazilian public laboratories, the uncovering of the zoonotic origins of major human viruses like hepatitis A and B virus, and the elucidation of central aspects of the epidemiology of the Latin American Zika virus outbreak.
